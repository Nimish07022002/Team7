The primary purpose of AFSC worldwide is to prevent collisions, organize and expedite the flow of air traffic, and provide information and other support for pilots. Countries use this simulator for a security or defensive purposes, or it is operated by the military.

<br/>Using the buttons below, you can either run a manual simulation process or an automated simulation process. In the case of random generation of the flight under known conditions, clicking on random generation will produce the flight in accordance with the known conditions. By choosing the manual option and adding the necessary details, you can produce flights based on your input. We maintain a simulator 24/7 to ensure aircraft are maintained at a safe distance in the air, on the ground, and land safely without any incident.</p>
